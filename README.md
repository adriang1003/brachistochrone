# The Brachistochrone Problem
Throughout history, mathematicians continuously sought to challenge themselves with a variety of optimization problems, one of which being the Brachistochrone problem or "shortest time" problem. Introduced in 1696 by mathematician Johann Bernoulli, this project aims to answer such a problem using an analytical approach. To this end, the problem is reconstructed in the Cartesian coordinate system, and thus reintroduced as an optimization of a functional. Analytical results on examples including the optimal curve between (0, 1) and (1, 0), and the optimal curve's travel time compared to elementary functions such as: a straight line, circle, and parabola suggests that the optimal curve we derived is, in fact, the solution to Bernoulli's problem. Additionally, analysis on how the results vary with the respective positions of the points A and B opens up possible use in practical applications.
